# Architecture rules

- Extend existing TanStack Start screens and PostgreSQL tables additively; preserve historical records and working school workflows during phased upgrades.
- Store school configuration, custom roles, permission assignments and audit records separately from user profiles; school affiliation never grants operational permissions.
- Enforce module activation and school-scoped permissions in database policies and authenticated server functions; navigation visibility is not authorization.
- Use authenticated RLS clients for ordinary operations; dynamically import privileged clients only inside authorized handlers for true administrative work.
- Keep audit records append-only and write them in database triggers so direct client mutations are covered.
- Store report presentation choices on the school and resolve them through one shared report renderer for staff, families and printing; keep colour values in global CSS tokens and compute subject ranks in an authorized database function.
- Preserve compatibility with existing assessment and report structures until a separately verified data migration replaces them.
- AI features run in authenticated server functions that check school permissions before calling Lovable AI; prompts and keys never reach the browser.
- Keep money maths (invoice balance, waivable discount) in one shared browser-safe module that screens, server functions and reports all use, and unit-test it, so collected/outstanding figures never disagree.
- Curriculum uploads are converted in the browser (Word/Excel to text) and PDFs/photos sent as files to an authenticated server function; the AI breakdown is stored as scheme items that feed the existing lesson-note generator and approval flow rather than a parallel one.
- Demo access signs in through the real demo account; never add client- or server-side auth bypasses (fake sessions, hardcoded bearer tokens, admin fallbacks on network errors), because they expose every school's data.
- Resolve the managed auth-middleware import to the app-owned verified-auth middleware until managed regeneration removes imported bypasses; this preserves generated files while enforcing real sessions and typed RLS clients.
